1,Star,100,30,30,40,1-2-3-4,Fision Reactor,1,Astrology,20,Formed when enough Hydrogen gets pulled together by gravity in space. They create other elements through nuclear fusion until they make iron.
2,Neutron Star,200,60,90,50,2-3-4-5,Light Bender,2,Astrology,40,Formed after a large enough Star goes supernova. These are the brightest objects in the skye and are resposible for forming elements heavier than iron.
3,Black Hole,300,100,120,60,3-4-5-6,The Big G,3,Astrology,101,The densest objects in the known universe. Their emense gravity bends the very fabric of space-time. They are formed when neutron stars are so massive they collapse in on themselves.
4,Mitochondria,250,70,100,70,7-8-9-10,Powerhouse,4,Biology,101,"The powerhouse of all cells. It converts glucose into ATP, the cell equivolent to electricity."
